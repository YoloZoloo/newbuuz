This is a poor man's implementation of https://code.google.com/archive/p/buuz/downloads for OSX.

## Why?
The sole reason to write this is to have extremely customizable keyboard. For example, we could have two physical keyboards and one of them is used for typing English and the other for typing Mongolian(Cyrillic) without having to switch keyboard from the settings.

## Other Mongolian Cyrillic keyboards
Here is a much fancier keyboard that you can use out-of-box.
